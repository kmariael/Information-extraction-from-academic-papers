# Information-extraction-from-academic-papers
This project was developed as a part of my Masters' thesis in the Department of Informatics AUEB. The goal was to train different Machine Learning classifiers that would extract certain types of information from academic papers. The conceptual framework of this procedure is Scholarly Ontology, an ontology schema which documents research processes.
